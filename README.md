# Wallet Connect Live App

This is a web application that uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
and is intended to be integrated within ledger products, enabling users to seamlessly connect to dapps supporting the walletconnect wallet adapter.

## Hosting

This live app is currently hosted at https://wc.apps.ledger.com

## Inputs

Behavior of the live app can be influenced by navigating to it with the following query parameters:

- `initialAccountId`: Defines the account selected by default.
- `uri`: Defines the WalletConnect URI the live app will attempt to connect to at startup.

## Params

This live app need parameters to be defined in the manifest file

```json
"params": {
      "networks": [
        {
          "currency": "ethereum", // currency id
          "chainId": 1 // evm network chain id
        }
      ]
    }
```

## Architecture

- Pages üìù (All the main screens)
- Components üíÑ (UI libray with part of screens and reusable components)
- Hooks üé£ (All the reusable logic)
- Storage üõí (All the stored (persistent or not) data to manage the running of the app )
- Data üìà (All the types for each chain and some payloads)

## Store Management

Use of [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) and `persist` middleware to have a persistent store via the `localStorage`

## Add new Chain support

Look at => `// TO UPDATE WHEN SUPPORTING NEW CHAIN` in code base

1 - Update `localManifest.json` by adding new entry in network

```json
{
	"currency": "arbitrum",
	"chainId": 42161
}
```

2 - Update `EIP155Data` or other file if not in this family. If this is a new family, create new file and apply same logic as `EIP155Data`.

3 - Update `useProposal` hook

Modify somes methods :

- `getNamespace`

# Will download and install the supported versions of nodejs, npm and pnpm.
# Run it from the root or a subfolder of the repository.
proto use
```

First, you should install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Manifest
